 abstract = {For the first time ever, secret reports and other documents have surfaced that reveal the inner workings of China's Communist Party leadership during the Tiananmen Square crisis of 1989. These materials, smuggled out of Beijing by a reform-minded individual, challenge the official picture of the crisis as the legitimate suppression of violent antigovernment protests. They detail what China's leaders knew at each stage of the events, and who made the fateful decision to send in the troops. For 11 years, the truth about Tiananmen Square has remained shrouded in mystery--until now.},
