\begin{document}
The first source to be evaluated is Zhang Liang’s \textit{The Tiananmen Papers}, a translated collection of secret Chinese documents surrounding the June 4th massacre published in 2001. This content of the source is valuable because it shows the situation in the Chinese Communist Party at the time of the massacre and the internal politics surrounding the decision to impose martial law in the capital. The purpose of the document was to reveal the internal party correspondence surrounding the June 4th incident, and bring to light some of the more political aspects of it within the Chinese Communist Party. The source is limited by the author’s choice to publish under a pseudonym to protect themselves from persecution. The legitimacy of the documents has been questioned by peers and is denied by the Chinese government.
